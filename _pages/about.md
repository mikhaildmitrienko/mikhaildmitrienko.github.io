Hi, my name is Mikhail. I am currently an undergrad at Columbia, where I study CS. I am interested in topics relating to private computation. Specifically, I am interested in developing privacy-preserving machine learning models and leveraging neural networks to perform encryption.  

I am currently based in New York City and Princeton, NJ.
