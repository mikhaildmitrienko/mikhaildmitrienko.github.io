Hi, my name is Mikhail. I am currently an undergrad at Columbia, where I study CS. I am very interested in topics at the intersection of cryptography and machine learning, especially differential privacy and adversarial neural cryptography. 

I am currently based in New York City and Princeton, NJ.
